Hello, I'm Caramel cc Cookie, just call me 'Caramel' or 'Cookie' or 'CCCC' is also okay. 

I'm 23 years old in Korean age, 21 as international.

My major is EECS and I'm interested in CS.

I take two year off from school nowadays, I just need to go to school for one semester.

I did internship at some labs of my school, and they were great, but I recognize that I need to do something from outside of school. 

And also I want to find something more interesting, so I delayed my graduation. 

Now I want to find and do something interesting. (Maybe works at somewhere company is good experience to me)


Using :

python (2 or 3, I use 3 for ranko_bot), C (I learned C++ but, I'm not good very good at C++)

R, Matlab, Julia (A little bit. For my major courses and internship I was needed to use them a little.)

Interested in (major):

Server-side programing, Data Analysis, Data mining, Machine learning, NLP 

Interested in :

reading books, listening musics, watching anime, playing game, chattering with my friends. 

Can speak with :

Korean (Yes, I'm Korean ;)
English (If you read this page, then you may feel that I'm not very good at English. But I thnk that, its enough to communicate with you)
Japenese (No problem for traveling but reading Kanji is so hard to me. I try to improve my reading skill.)


My programming practice and just for fun, I made [ranko_bot](https://github.com/caramelcccookie/ranko_kor) 
 and [ranko_web.](https://github.com/caramelcccookie/ranko_web)

You can test it on [ranko-kr on heroku](https://ranko-kr.herokuapp.com/ranko/)

If you need to ask something to me, please mail me caramelcccookie at gmail.com

Thank you.
